Got it. You want **frontend pages + admin pages**, and **who can access what** (roles & permissions). For a dental chamber system, this is crucial. I’ll make it practical and traditional.

# 1️⃣ Roles Recap

From your DB, you have:

* **Admin** → Full control
* **Doctor** → Only patient & treatment info
* **Receptionist** → Appointments, billing, patient registration
* **Assistant / Staff** → Inventory, lab requests, minor edits

We’ll map pages accordingly.

# 2️⃣ Pages & Access Table

| Page / Module          | URL / Route        | Roles Allowed               | Notes                                             |

# 3️⃣ Page Access Rules (Example Logic)

```text
IF user.role = 'Admin' THEN full access
IF user.role = 'Doctor' THEN
   can_view_patients
   can_create_treatment
   can_add_prescriptions
   can_view_lab_requests
IF user.role = 'Receptionist' THEN
   can_view_patients
   can_create_appointments
   can_manage_invoices
   can_record_payments
IF user.role = 'Assistant' THEN
   can_view_inventory
   can_update_inventory
```

**Implementation Tip:**
In Laravel, use **Middleware**:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['auth', 'role:Admin']], function () {
    Route::get('/doctors', [DoctorController::class, 'index']);
});
```

* You can also make **dynamic permissions table** if you want per-page, but for a mid-sized chamber, **role-based is enough**.

---

# 4️⃣ Optional: Dynamic Page Table (if you want DB-driven access)

```sql
CREATE TABLE pages (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  route VARCHAR(100),
  created_at DATETIME,
  updated_at DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE page_access {
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  page_id INT,
  role_id INT,
  can_view BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  can_edit BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  FOREIGN KEY (page_id) REFERENCES pages(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id)
}
```

This lets you add **new pages without touching code**. But for now, the **role → static page mapping** is simpler.

If you want, I can **draw a DB diagram for pages + access** similar to the one we did for patients & treatments.

Do you want me to do that?
